# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project is a Go-based, text-based RPG called "Justicar." It uses the Gemini API to generate dynamic, narrative-driven gameplay and Supabase to persist player data. The game is set in a gritty, near-future world where the player takes on the role of Caleb Reed, a 21-year-old student who becomes the world's first trillionaire.

The project is structured as follows:

*   `main.go`: The main entry point of the application. It handles the connection to Supabase, checks for existing player data, and initiates the game loop.
*   `prompt.go`: Contains the system prompt that provides the initial context and instructions to the Gemini model for generating the game's narrative.
*   `go.mod` and `go.sum`: Manage the project's dependencies, which include the Gemini API client, the Supabase client, and a library for managing environment variables.
*   `.env`: A file to store the necessary API keys and credentials for Supabase and the Gemini API.

## Building and Running

To build and run this project, you will need to have Go installed on your system.

1.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following lines, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

    ```
    SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
    SUPABASE_KEY="your_supabase_key"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to download and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Run the Game:**

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the game with the following command:

    ```bash
    go run .
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Dependency Management:** The project uses Go modules for dependency management. Any new dependencies should be added using `go get`.
*   **Environment Variables:** All secrets and environment-specific configurations are managed through a `.env` file using the `godotenv` library.
*   **Database:** The game uses Supabase to store player data. The `Player` struct in `main.go` defines the schema for the `player` table.
*   **AI-Generated Content:** The narrative of the game is generated by the Gemini API. The `prompt.go` file contains the core system prompt that guides the AI's responses.
